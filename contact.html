                    Young adults who have accessed the counselling service,
                     and have been seen by Nicky, have fed back that counselling sessions were:<br>

                   <br> “Helpful, and that they felt understood.”<br>
                    
                    <br>Clients felt that their counselling sessions were kept completely
                     confidential, and would recommend the service to others.<br>
                    
                   <br> Clients felt that they were listened to, and were helped to explore
                     their worries. They felt supported if referred to another service when appropriate.<br>
                    
                   <br> Clients felt that counselling helped them to remain in their current
                     establishment, and that it helped them to achieve their goals.<br>
